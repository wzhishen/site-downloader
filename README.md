site-downloader
===============

This is a funny site crawler implemented in Scala.

Given the URL of a page that contains zero or more images and references zero or more subpages, download all web pages (.htm and .html), and images (.gif, .jpg, and .png) from that site, under desired depth limit.

The entry point is object <code>SiteDownloader</code>.
Run it and launch the GUI to start downloading =)
